The problem we are trying to solve is to create a classification model to distinguish between malicious emails and legitimate emails. Spam email classification is
an active area of research in NLP. This project provides a potential solution for a spam text classification model based on machine learning techniques.

The dataset consists of 5572 rows, with 4825 rows representing legitimate messages, accounting for 86.59% of the dataset, and 474 rows representing
spam messages, accounting for 13.41% of the dataset.

The data was downloaded from Kaggle: [spam-text-message-classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/team-ai/spam-text-message-classification)
